/*
Insertion Sort

Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a sorted version of
that array. Use the Insertion Sort algorithm to sort the array.

example:
array = [8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3]
output => [2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9]

not the most performant sorting algo,
but easy to understand and easy to implement
*/

const insertionSort = (array) => {};
