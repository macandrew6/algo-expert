/*
Depth-first Search

You're given a Node class that has a name and an array of optional 
children nodes. When put together, nodes form an acyclic tree-like 
structure.

Implement the depthFirstSearch method on the Node class, which
takes in an empty array, traverses the tree using the Depth-first 
Search approach (specifically navigating the tree from left to right),
stores all the nodes' names in the input array, and returns it.
